# Amazon - a data-stealing devil, or a retailer dedicated to fulfilling consumer desires?


Amazon has transformed itself from an online bookstore, to a tech giant today. A lot of this is a result of not only the services or products they offer, but also how they offer them. We will observe the two point of views to this through the two articles: [Amazon knows a lot about us. Should we be worried?](https://www.teiss.co.uk/amazon-knows-a-lot-about-us-should-we-be-worried/) and [Amazon Knows What You Buy. And It’s Building a Big Ad Business From It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html)


## 1. [Amazon knows a lot about us. Should we be worried?](https://www.teiss.co.uk/amazon-knows-a-lot-about-us-should-we-be-worried/)

An extremely valuable commodity of today’s digital age is data. How this data helps is through understanding of behavior and preferences of a huge global market of users on the internet, which helps in accurate ad targeting and ecommerce product preferencing, besides many others. However, Amazon’s increasing scale of data collection through an enormous range of mediums may lead many to consider it to an even frightening extent, as the article suggests. Besides user’s buying patterns and routines, it also collects what they search for and how many times they click on the search item. It further collects the following:

•	Your location

•	The device(s) you are using

•	Alexa voice assistant interactions, including specific songs and the time of the request; these are perhaps the most controversial of all

•	Your Kindle use, including exact time of day for each tap

•	Your detailed clickstreams: these are the trails that show which sites users come from, how they travel through Amazon's own pages, and where they go to next

On an immediate basis, it gives Amazon, the seller of its product, an immediate edge over its consumers. It knows their buying patterns and needs, through which they can analyze a buyer’s willingness and ability to pay. This is not only a consequence of the amazon databases and data analyses systems knowing what a user wants, but their voice assistant devices such as Alexa, are even capable to analyze user emotions. This helps them in both setting product pricing according to the variables, as well as manipulating customers and persuading them to buy more. Beyond this, Amazon has been stepping up to compete Google and Facebook in the Ad-tech industry. Through the enormous information it acquires on its users, it not only boosts its sales to the user, but opens its ad platforms to targeted marketing. Hence, in the scenario, not only user’s privacy and integrity remains compromised to Amazon, but the user’s data, and with it, their information, remain a commodity that Amazon uses to sell services to other parties as well.

This article, and many others, also emphasize on Alexa assistant’s particular data collection of user in background, even when they haven’t been actively used. The surveillance this causes not only worrisome, but also poses the strong concerns and questions of the utility of tech advancements vs the spying nature that comes along. While Amazon, or other ecommerce business would market the fact that this user data collection benefits user experience, the worry of not only the extent of information Amazon collects from the user, but also how it uses to exploits its customers


## 2. [Amazon Knows What You Buy. And It’s Building a Big Ad Business From It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html)

On the contrary to above, the article, [Amazon Knows What You Buy. And It’s Building a Big Ad Business From It,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html), from New York Times shows a different perspective to the Amazon business. This article reserves its opinion, but rather goes on to explain the power and benefit Amazon produces through its data collection process from its customers. The article particularly considers this in terms of its ads business, and compares how different and effective it is to its competitors, Facebook or Google. To explain briefly, Amazon’s ads work in the following way: they collect their consumers data in various ways, mainly through their online shopping behavior, searches, and lifestyles. By analyzing user based on their purchase histories, Amazon seems to be in a better position, to at least target ads that sell specific goods. This is different to Google or Facebook, for example, in that they rather go for user’s browsing history, friend groups, locations, etc. How this may give Amazon ads an edge, particularly in goods selling businesses is that it removes the guesswork, and directs ads to users that target their buying patterns and behaviors rather than finding a roundabout through their social lifestyles. To add to it further, Amazon also runs a diversified business, such as one with video streaming platform, or selling of smart devices. Together, these help to bring its users data from a multitude of resources.

The article appreciates highlights the revolution this brings to the ecommerce business, to both sellers and customers (particularly for Amazon). For the selling parties, it produces unmatched ad successes, as instead of targeting huge audiences for small returns, with extraordinary data on internet users, the ads can be directed to much more specific audiences, with much better purchase results. For the user, it enhances the shopping experience, particularly when its online retailer knows what they want better then them themselves. In the age of smart technologies, this just adds to the package of convenience that an all-round technology brings to the user.


## Concluding Thoughts:

To provide an analysis of the two articles, I would observe that both provide interesting viewpoints regarding to their perspectives. The debate remains between the user choice of a better consumer experience or privacy of its information. Or rather to frame it better, what’s the optimal balance in today’s technology. However, the main cause of concern in my opinion would be the fact that do the user’s even have a choice. No matter how many scams come up, at this point, Amazon or many other big techs hardly seem to be under any accountability or regulation. Their monopolies have made their users absolutely reliant on them and there doesn’t seem to be a voice powerful at the moment to even allow user the choice of what balance they prefer.
